# Vaporwaves
Simple shooter game created in few days. Also, first complete game, after series of Biggest Newbie Mistakes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPp1iIC_PJ0).

Don't try to use my code. This game was developed in a hurry, just to test my game jam capabilities. Code isn't nice.

Amazing music by Stevia Sphere.

Sounds recorded by my own, or downloaded from soundbible.com (gunshot by GoodSoundForYou, http://soundbible.com/1998-Gun-Fire.html)
